The heterogeneous and complex behaviour of these transportation modes, however, indicates the need for a shift from the traditional car and public transport centred modelling approaches towards incorporating the requirements for walking and cycling behaviour, while maintaining the run-time efficiency of the models. In this paper, we introduce and test our algorithm to create road network representations, designed and optimised to be used in city-scale active transportation modelling. The algorithm relies on open and universal data. In addition to the major roads and attributes typically used in transport modelling (e.g., speed limit, number of lanes, permitted travel modes), the algorithm also captures minor roads usually favoured by pedestrians and cyclists, along with road attributes such as bicycle-specific infrastructure, traffic signals, road gradient and road surface type. Furthermore, it simplifies the complex geometries of the network and merges parallel roads, if applicable, to make it suitable for large-scale simulations. \n\nTo examine the utility and performance of the algorithm, we used it to create a network representation for Greater Melbourne, Australia, and compared the output with a network created using an existing simulation toolkit along with another network from an existing city-scale transport model from the Victorian government. Through simulation experiments with these networks, we illustrated that for routed trips on our network for walking and cycling, it is of comparable accuracy to the common network conversion tools in terms of travel distance of the shortest paths while being more than two times faster when used for simulating different sample sizes. Therefore, our algorithm offers a flexible and adjustable solution for users to create road networks for city-scale active transport modelling while balancing between their desired simulation accuracy and run-time.","tags":null,"title":"Building the road network for city-scale active transport simulation models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Afshin Jafari","Dhirendra Singh","Alan Both","Lucy Gunn","Steve Pemberton","Billie Giles-Corti"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639526400,"objectID":"8478407eb83ea086f230923c518fe040","permalink":"https://matsim-melbourne.github.io/publication/2021-atom/","publishdate":"2021-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-atom/","section":"publication","summary":"Agent-based and activity-based models for simulating transportation systems have attracted significant attention in recent years. Few studies, however, include a detailed representation of active modes of transportation - such as walking and cycling - at a city-wide level, where dominating motorised modes are often of primary concern. This paper presents an open workflow for creating a multi-modal agent-based and activity-based transport simulation model, focusing on Greater Melbourne, and including the process of mode choice calibration for the four main travel modes of driving, public transport, cycling and walking. \n\nThe synthetic population generated and used as an input for the simulation model represented Melbourne's population based on Census 2016, with daily activities and trips based on the Victoria's 2016-18 travel survey data. The road network used in the simulation model includes all public roads accessible via the included travel modes. We compared the output of the simulation model with observations from the real world in terms of mode share, road volume, travel time, and travel distance. Through these comparisons, we showed that our model is suitable for studying mode choice and road usage behaviour of travellers.","tags":null,"title":"Activity-based and agent-based Transport model of Melbourne (AToM): an open multi-modal transport simulation model for Greater Melbourne","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alan Both","Dhirendra Singh","Afshin Jafari","Billie Giles-Corti","Lucy Gunn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637280000,"objectID":"652ad3f3c2971a0fc52b043bd3f3dbc5","permalink":"https://matsim-melbourne.github.io/publication/2021-virtual-population/","publishdate":"2021-11-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-virtual-population/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present an algorithm for creating a synthetic population for the Greater Melbourne area using a combination of machine learning, probabilistic, and gravity-based approaches. We combine these techniques in a hybrid model with three primary innovations: 1. when assigning activity patterns, we generate individual activity chains for every agent, tailored to their cohort; 2. when selecting destinations, we aim to strike a balance between the distance-decay of trip lengths and the activity-based attraction of destination locations; and 3. we take into account the number of trips remaining for an agent so as to ensure they do not select a destination that would be unreasonable to return home from. Our method is completely open and replicable, requiring only publicly available data to generate a synthetic population of agents compatible with commonly used agent-based modeling software such as MATSim. The synthetic population was found to be accurate in terms of distance distribution, mode choice, and destination choice for a variety of population sizes.","tags":null,"title":"An Activity-Based Model of Transport Demand for Greater Melbourne","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Jian Yang and Monica Hall for winning the Best Paper Award at the 2020 Conference on Wowchemy for their paper “Learning Wowchemy”.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
