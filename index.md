## What is AToM​

AToM is a city-scale multi-modal transport simulation, modelling a full day in the transportation system of Melbourne for understanding intended and unintended consequences of a change in the environment on individuals’ travel behaviour​.
AToM is an open-source simulation model that to represent mobility on a typical mid-weekday in Melbourne. ​

AToM includes transportation by car, public transport, cycling, and walking and models travel behaviours at an individual traveller and road segment level. ​Using the baseline mobility of Melbourne captured in AToM, it is possible to examine impacts of “what-if” built environment interventions on travel behaviour​.

## Why use AToM

- AToM creates a realistic representation of the transportation sytem by creating the traffic demand based on individuals’ activities throughout the day;
- AToM is multi-modal and captures the impact of changes in one mode on mode choice and route choice of all four main modes of travel;
- AToM is open-source to maximise the clarify of model assumptions and processes and to make future collaborations more effective;
- Using AToM it is possible to includes individual’s heterogenous behaviours in their mode and route choice​;
-​ AToM is developed by a multi-disciplinary team of experts in transport modelling, AI, GIS, and public health and built-environment.
