	abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for creating a synthetic population for the Greater Melbourne area using a combination of machine learning, probabilistic, and gravity-based approaches. We combine these techniques in a hybrid model with three primary innovations: 1. when assigning activity patterns, we generate individual activity chains for every agent, tailored to their cohort; 2. when selecting destinations, we aim to strike a balance between the distance-decay of trip lengths and the activity-based attraction of destination locations; and 3. we take into account the number of trips remaining for an agent so as to ensure they do not select a destination that would be unreasonable to return home from. Our method is completely open and replicable, requiring only publicly available data to generate a synthetic population of agents compatible with commonly used agent-based modeling software such as {MATSim}. The synthetic population was found to be accurate in terms of distance distribution, mode choice, and destination choice for a variety of population sizes.},
